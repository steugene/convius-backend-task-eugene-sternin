## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly by:

### 📧 Email

Send an email to: **eu.steinberg@gmail.com**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### 📬 What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- **Status Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical security issues within 30 days

### 🏆 Responsible Disclosure

We follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process:

1. **Report received** - We acknowledge and begin investigation
2. **Issue confirmed** - We confirm the vulnerability and determine severity
3. **Fix developed** - We develop and test a fix
4. **Fix released** - We release the fix and security advisory
5. **Public disclosure** - Details may be shared publicly after fix is deployed

## 🔐 Security Measures

Our application implements several security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Token expiration and refresh

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- CORS protection
- Rate limiting

### Infrastructure Security
- Environment variable management
- Secure Docker configurations
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Development Security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis (Bandit)
- Security-focused code reviews
- Regular security updates

## 🛠️ Security Tools

We use the following tools to maintain security:

- **Bandit** - Python security linter
- **Safety** - Dependency vulnerability checker
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Security checks before commits

## 📋 Security Checklist

### For Developers

- [ ] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Authentication is required for sensitive operations
- [ ] Authorization checks are implemented
- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged
- [ ] Dependencies are kept up to date
- [ ] Security tests are included

### For Deployment

- [ ] Environment variables are properly secured
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Database access is restricted
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are configured
- [ ] Backups are encrypted
- [ ] Access logs are maintained

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Currently implemented at application level only
2. **Session Management**: JWT tokens don't support server-side invalidation
